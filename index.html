                Scrum Lake workshops are interactive sessions where Scrum enthusiasts of all levels can 
                hare stories, learn techniques and deepen their understanding of Scrum. You will work with 
                an experienced facilitator and other Scrum Masters to co-create and explore various aspects 
                of Scrum in a two-hour workshop. You will have the chance to dive into topics such as values, 
                trust, empiricism, Lean thinking, artifacts, events or accountabilities. You will also benefit 
                from the supportive metaphors and the diverse opinions that emerge from the group.

Ryan spends his time working with teams and organisations to change their mindset from 'delivery at whatever cost' to 'value at whatever cost'. 
He uses creativity and a positive attitude to affect change. Improving organisational 'culture' is the backbone of Ryan's practice. 
Without it, he believes teams are not able to reap the benefits of an empirical framework. 
He resides in Gloucester, UK, with his young family and loves walking his dog.

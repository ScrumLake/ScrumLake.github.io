  </h2>


  <div>

<p>
  Scrum Lake is a collaborative and interactive workshop that helps you explore your own challenges and opportunities 
  of Scrum, its a place to be real. You will join other Scrum practitioners and share your stories, insights, and learnings 
  from applying Scrum in real-world scenarios. You will also deepen your understanding of the Scrum framework and its 
  principles, and come up with actionable improvements. 
</p>

  <p>
  The workshop is two hours long and uses a Miro canvas to facilitate the discussion and activities. It is not a 
  training session, but you will learn a lot from your peers and gain new perspectives on Scrum. Scrum Lake is a 
  great way to connect with other Scrum enthusiasts and improve your own Scrum practice.
</p>

<p><h3>Why a Lake?</h3></p>
<p>Scrum Lake is a metaphor for the Scrum framework. Our lake is a&nbsp;container for other metaphors such as a submarine and&nbsp;explorers (Scrum Team and Accountabilities), a ship (events), items that represent work or value (artefacts and&nbsp;commitments to), Bedrock (The Values of&nbsp;Commitment, Courage, Focus, Openness and Respect)&nbsp;and the Sedimentary layers (Scrum Theory and Empiricism)&nbsp;plus many more to visualise and help folks to connect more deeply.&nbsp; Our metaphors and images are&nbsp;all carefully crafted to promote discussion of tough concepts. Importantly, these are the metaphors we have designed. Don't like them? Come up with your own and share it with the participants. Metaphors are powerful if they are emotional and personal. Buy into ours, or craft your own!<br></p>
<p><h3>What are the workshops all about?</h3></p>
<p>Using a pre-prepared canvas, you and your fellow explorers will dive into Scrum Lake. In a typical two hour event, you will co-create the journey through the lake as a team, supported by experienced Scrum Masters (Dive Masters) at all times.</p>

<p><h3>Where we explore, is down to you</h3></p>
<p>Do you want to investigate how you can make the artefacts in Scrum Lake more transparent? 
  Take a deeper look at Scrum theory? Investigate how poorly defined accountabilities can 
  impact your Scrum Team? How does empiricism flow and come to life building trust&nbsp;and 
  how does it does link into the embodiment of values?&nbsp;These are the kind of questions we 
  explore in Scrum Lake, we exploring them in a human way sharing our stories with each and 
  exploring the reality, and what can be.&nbsp;It's all there... within a shared experience.
